The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. the house of representatives approved the bill earlier this month. the trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from congress. \",\n          \"budapest (reuters) - about a thousand hungarians protested on friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. despite the gloomy rhetoric and jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. hungarians will vote for a new parliament in april and prime minister viktor orban s conservative, anti-migrant fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with jobbik its nearest rival. jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . last week the state audit office (asz) ruled jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. the protesters, waving jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of orban s fidesz party.  what we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. it is not an official penalty. this is a death sentence with jobbik s name on it. but in reality, it is a death sentence for hungarian democracy,  jobbiik leader gabor vona told the crowd. a government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. asz chairman laszlo domokos is a former fidesz lawmaker, whom jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of orban. the audit office denies that. on friday, asz again called on jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. the ruling fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the asz probe.  this case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  orban aide janos lazar said on thursday. for over a year fidesz has targeted jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst zoltan novak at the centre for fair political analysis. gyorgy illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  this asz probe is a clear sign that orban is way past any remedy. it is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"beijing/taipei (reuters) - china accused the united states on thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after u.s. president donald trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible u.s. navy visits to self-ruled taiwan. tensions have risen in recent days after a senior chinese diplomat threatened china would invade taiwan if any u.s. warships made port visits to the island which china claims as its own territory. on monday, chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. on tuesday, trump signed into law the national defense authorization act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between taiwan and the united states. such visits would be the first since the united states ended formal diplomatic relations with taiwan in 1979 and established ties with beijing. chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said while the taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  one china  policy and  constitute an interference in china s internal affairs .   china is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the u.s. government,  lu told a daily news briefing. china is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between taiwan and the united states, he added.  proudly democratic taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in china s military deployments as irresponsible. taiwan presidential spokesman alex huang, speaking to taiwan media in comments reported late on wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , huang said. both sides of the narrow taiwan strait, which separates taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  huang was quoted as saying. relations have soured considerably since tsai ing-wen, who leads taiwan s independence-leaning democratic progressive party, won presidential elections last year. china suspects tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for beijing. tsai says she wants to maintain peace with china but will defend taiwan s security. taiwan is well equipped with mostly u.s. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from china. the united states is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. china has never renounced the use of force to bring taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n
